## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Project 1. I picked Zomato Banglore city eateries rundown and subtleties.

As I love food more than everything else, so I picked this dataset for information investigation.

My key questions that are answered in this blog post  would be:

1. Which sort of cafés are giving table booking office in the bengaluru city? 

2. Which region in the city have increasingly number of cafés found? 

3. What are the least expensive and the exorbitant costs of the cafés in various parts ofthe city?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

you can find the data set "https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants"

The fundamental idea of separating the Zomato dataset is to get a sensible idea with respect to the factors impacting the establishment. Out of different sorts of the bistro at better places in Bengaluru, the all-out rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru. Being one such city has more than 12,000 bistros with diners serving dishes from wherever all through the world. With consistently new bistros starting the business hasn't been submerged now and the intrigue is growing. bit by bit. Due to extending demand, it in any case has gotten difficult for new diners to battle with set up bistros. Most of them serving comparable food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are poor for the most part on the restaurant food as they don't have the chance to cook for themselves. With such an awesome solicitation of bistros, it has thusly gotten basic to mull over the demography of a zone. What kind of food is progressively notable in a region. Do the entire domain reveres veggie darling food. In case for sure, by then is that locale populated by a particular association of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are by and large veggie lover.
